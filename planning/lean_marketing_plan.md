## ü§ñ Content Automation Strategy

### **Automated Weekly Newsletter: "AI Market Pulse"**

**Setup Once, Runs Forever:**

```python
# Pseudo-code for automated content generation
def generate_weekly_newsletter():
    # Pull top 5 stocks from your existing ranking algorithm
    top_stocks = get_top_ranked_stocks(limit=5)
    
    # Auto-generate simple analysis
    content = f"""
    Veckans Top 5 enligt Indicatum AI:
    
    {format_stock_list(top_stocks)}
    
    Denna vecka s√•g vi {sector_rotation_summary()}
    TTM-signaler: {ttm_highlights()}
    
    Testa verktyget: [link]
    """
    
    send_newsletter(content)

# Schedule this to run every Monday 6 AM
```

**Implementation:**
- Use your existing algorithm to auto-generate weekly insights
- Mailchimp automation sends it out
- **Time investment:** 30 min setup, 0 min/week ongoing

### **Auto-Generated Social Media Posts**

**Daily LinkedIn Posts (Automated):**
- Pull interesting findings from your daily data refresh
- Auto-post "Today's biggest mover: [STOCK] up X% - here's why our AI flagged it"
- Use Zapier/Buffer to schedule

**Sample Auto-Post Templates:**
```
"üö® TTM Alert: {STOCK_NAME} shows {PERCENTAGE}% improvement vs last year
Our AI ranking: {RANK}/100
Sector: {SECTOR}
What do you think? ü§î
