The company was formed in 2017 and operates throughout the country. The strategy is to acquire existing residential properties and land for new construction in growth regions. The company's newly constructed apartments are developed in-house and space efficient, which contributes to reasonable rents. Both apartments and buildings are designed in collaboration with the municipality to fit local needs. Using mainly sustainable building materials, the company's new construction holds a high environmental standard. KlaraBo is a long-term property owner. The company focuses on residential properties, which comprised 89 per cent of contracted rents on 30 June. As of 30 June, KlaraBo's property portfolio had a lettable area of approximately 556,000 square metres distributed across 7,431 apartments and a number of commercial premises with contracted annual rent of about SEK 736 million. The portfolio also includes 809 apartments under project development."
